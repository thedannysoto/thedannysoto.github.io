My first exposure to programming was in high school. We were required to own TI-83 graphing calculators for our math classes. These calculators were able to run basic games and programs writting in TI-BASIC, a programming language based off of the BASIC programming language. Through trial and error, I figured out how to make simple programs that would regugitate information I needed to remember or store formulas for calculations that were done frequently. I enjoyed tinkering with my TI-83, but at the time, I didn't make the connection between that and computer programming or software engineering. 

After high school, I went to Tulane University in New Orleans.  I took an Intro to Computer Science class where we learned the basics of programming in C++. My favorite part of the class was building a program that would calculate the sides and angles of a triangle and tell the user what kind of triangle it was. I enjoyed this class so much, that I considered switching my major to Computer Science. However, August of 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans, and I took that semester off from school to aid in the rebuilding efforts throughout the city. After returning to school the following January, I found out that they had cut some majors from the program including Computer Science. I ended up graduating with a Legal Studies in Business degree in 2009.

Since graduating from Tulane University, I dabbled in HTML & CSS with some website development and I started learning the Python programming language, just for fun. I would occasionally think about how I would enjoy having a job in the software engineering field, but I thought that the only way to make that happend would be to get another degree from a university. I didn't think I would have the time or financial resources to make that happen. Towards the end of 2019, I began to hear about coding bootcamps and how you didn't have to necessarily have a 4 year degree from a university in order to get a job in software engineering. I started to seriously consider jumping into a coding bootcamp. I researched some more and I found out about Flatiron School. The program style, length, and financial commitment seemed like a perfect fit for my situation, and I decided to go all in on software engineering.

Surveying the tech landscape nowadays, it's easy to see that the demand for programming and software engineering and web development are continuously increasing. Almost every company has a web presence or a mobile app, and that won't be slowing down anytime soon. I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of programming, and the logic of it just fits my style of thinking so well. After one week at Flatiron, I'm glad I made the leap and I'm excited to tackle the next six months of developing into a software engineer.
